					<p class = "content">Typically, in Southern California, summers are warm and dry while winter are damp and mild.  Rain season begins in October - November usually very light.  December, January, and February are the heaviest rain months.  Then season usually ends March - April which tends to be very light as well.  On average Southern California will see 300 Sunny days a year.  While average high temperatures in San Diego, my favorite city of all time, will run mid to upper 60's during the winter and mid to upper 70's during the summer. </p>

				<article>
					<p class = "content">With the weather being one of the key features of Southern California, outdoors is the most popular place to be.  Beaches are amazing and plentiful.  Surfing, swimming, volleyball, multiple beach activities.  There are tide pools and light houses always close by as well.  For amusement parks, how about Universal Studios, Disneyland, Sea World, San Diego Zoo, Knottâ€™s Berry Farm, Six Flags, Legoland, multiple more as well as a few water parks.  The piers are a great place to spend an evening.  Some piers have the occasional roller coaster or Ferris wheel.  But all have great bars, restaurants, ice cream spots, all with great outdoor patios to sit and watch the sun set</p>
